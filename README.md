# HABIT TRACKER


## The Habit Tracker is a web-based application designed to help users develop and maintain healthy habits. The app allows users to add their own custom habits, as well as view and track progress on pre-set default habits like drinking water, sleeping, and exercising. For each habit, users can see their streaks and the number of days they've successfully completed a habit.

### Project Description
The app features a calendar-style grid where each month is displayed, and completed days are marked with a color corresponding to the habit. This provides users with a clear visual representation of their progress over time. Habit data, including completed days and streaks, is saved in localStorage, ensuring that progress is preserved even when the user closes the browser.

Users have the flexibility to add new habits with unique colors, delete habits they no longer want to track, and view detailed statistics, such as their current and longest streaks. The user-friendly design encourages consistency and motivates users to stay on track with their goals, offering a simple and engaging way to build better habits over time.


### The Problem statement
Many people struggle to build good habits or break bad ones. A Habit Tracker app helps users set goals, track their habits, and monitor progress over time. It provides reminders, visualizes progress (like streaks or graphs), and offers motivation to stay consistent. The goal is to make it easy for users to improve their daily routines and develop lasting habits.





### The Solution
### Solution Statement:

The Habit Tracker is a web application that helps users track and maintain their habits. It allows users to view a monthly calendar, mark completed days, and track streaks for habits. Users can add custom habits, set daily reminders, and receive progress updates. The app stores data in `localStorage` for persistence, making it easy to track habits over time and stay motivated.
